## Agenda

### Spanning Cloud Services across Azure and AWS

With the evolution of cloud computing many companies are migrating their applications and services to the cloud or even build their own cloud native applications, yet they figure out limitations or better solutions in another cloud platform.

Within this session, you will learn how to get the most outta Azure and AWS by spanning your services across them with some scenarios discussing how to integrate these services.
