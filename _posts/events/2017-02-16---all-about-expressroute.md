<p>Back in September, we had loads of great feedback on <a href="/events/2016-09-26---azure-networking-from-rookie-to-expert">our Azure Networking session</a>. We decided to do more of that, and dedicate an evening to ExpressRoute. We're hosted (no pun intended) by Colt Technology Services tonight and will have two sessions on Azure ExpressRoute - from an operator point of view and from an ExpressRoute user point of view.</p>

<h2>Sessions</h2>
<h3>Using Dedicated Cloud Access to connect to the cloud</h3>
<p>Enterprises increasingly use private network connectivity solutions to access public cloud platforms such as Microsoft Azure. Dedicated private cloud connectivity provides improved performance and security compared to the public internet, enabling &nbsp;enterprise to connect to the public cloud seamlessly.</p>
<p>Colt will focus on network solutions on demand emphasizing our proposition &ldquo;Dedicated Cloud Access&rdquo; (DCA) &ndash; and how customers can connect to the public cloud over secure and reliable network infrastructure.</p>

<h3>How Microsoft connects customers using dedicated fiber with Azure ExpressRoute</h3>
<p>With Azure ExpressRoute, Microsoft has automated the flexibility for customers to connect using dedicated fiber to its Cloud Platform.</p>
<p>What is this ExpressRoute? How does it work and how do you set it up? How is it implemented to support global and massive scale? What about security? What about multi-tenancy? How does customer isolation work? How is it high available?</p>
<p>Interested in finding an answer to all these questions? Then join us for a deep dive on Azure ExpressRoute!</p>
