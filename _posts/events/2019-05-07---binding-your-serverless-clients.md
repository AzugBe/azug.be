Want to learn how you can write your own Azure Function bindings from Jan de Vries? Or hear Maarten Balliauw talk about 6 years of Bootstrapping a SaaS on Azure? Then this event is for you!

## Agenda

### Binding your serverless clients

Scaling your services to hundreds of instances without breaking a sweat is probably the main reason you want to develop a serverless solution. But what about connecting to services which aren't supported out of the box? Are you creating your own `HttpClient`, `SqlConnection` or connecting via some obscure third-party client?

During this session, I'll be covering how you can create your own Azure Function custom binding types.

By using these custom binding types you can reuse them all over your solution, use some of the best practices for each binding type and make sure your Azure Functions can interact and scale to any service with ease!

If you want to create a production-ready serverless solution, be sure to attend this session!

### 6 years of Bootstrapping a SaaS on Azure

After 6 years, the SaaS that I've been bootstrapping was acquired in July 2018. In this talk, I'll do a retrospective on those years, covering a multitude of technical and non-technical things: the ups and downs of bootstrapping a company, .NET/Azure evolution, fun new laws like GDPR and their impact on a codebase, handling customer support, and some advice in case you aspire to bootstrap a SaaS company as well. Grab a chair, bring any questions you may have, and let's get this Azurecoholics Anonymous self-help group rolling!
