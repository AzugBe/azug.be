We have observed the current quantum state and it looks like a meetup is happening! Expct quantum theory, Microsoft Q# and Azure Quantum.

## Agenda

### Microsoft Q# and Azure Quantum

You've probably heard about quantum computing, but it still remains a mystery?

In this deep-dive session, I will explain important concepts like qubits, superposition, and entanglement
Theoretical knowledge about quantum physics, quantum gates, and quantum algorithms will be combined
with some examples on Microsoft Q# and Azure Quantum.
