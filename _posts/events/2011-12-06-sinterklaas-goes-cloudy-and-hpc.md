<p>Just like last year, AZUG planned an event on December 6, the day "Sinterklaas" delivers toys and candy to a lot of children. To reach&nbsp;such a broad audience quickly, he requires&nbsp;some high-performance computing. And that's exactly what Kurt Claeys joins us for on this tuesday!</p>
<h2>Session info</h2>
<p><strong><img alt="" align="right" src="https://azug.be/assets/media/speakers/kurt-claeys.jpg" width="73" height="73">High Performance Computing with Azure</strong></p>
<p>High performance computing (or HPC, formerly known as TC) is all about massive number crunching, performing loads of parallel calculations, solving complex simulation models with many different parameters, rendering images &hellip; These are workloads that typically need loads of CPU power to perform and where the time to finish the calculation is important. So why don&rsquo;t we use Azure compute for this ? Azure provides compute nodes on demand. Typically these calculations only need to be done once, so Azure could solve the problem without an investment in hardware. Scenarios in HPC are : financial simulations, insurance predictions, video rendering, chemical calculations, &hellip; even weather and earthquake forecasts.</p>
<p>In this session we see how Windows HPC server (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/hpc">https://www.microsoft.com/hpc</a>) can use Azure to spread out the calculation logic across many workerroles. We discuss the typical scenarios and show how they are implemented in some demos : a number crunching executable, rendering images and a financial model in Excel offloading calculations to Azure. We&rsquo;ll see both the developer aspect and configuring the HPC Server part.</p>
<p>After this session you&rsquo;ll realize that Azure is not only about hosting web apps or storing data. It&rsquo;s also about massive compute power on demand. HPC could be one of the most important workloads for Azure in the future.</p>
