<p><img width="157" height="91" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/media/Event/madn.png">AZUG and MADN present... A joint event! We're sorry about that lame rhyme, we're less sorry about what we're up to.&nbsp;Short summary: coding, cloud, Windows 8 and barbeque!</p>
<h2>When AZUG meets MADN</h2>
<p>With the general availability of&nbsp;Windows 8 and the release of Windows Phone 8, it is time to bundle forces and to let you experience the true power of mobile and cloud. Scalability and reach, 2 solid platforms, a match made in heaven.</p>
<p>On Saturday November 17th, Windows Azure will meet Windows 8 on a fun event where you take the lead in developing something and where you can show off your skills. 7 mobile geeks and 7 cloud freaks will be there to assist you in building the next killer app and will support you with demos and tips and tricks. You will have the opportunity to show other people what you created and you will be awarded with great prizes.<br>&nbsp;<br>After all that hard work, BBQ will be waiting for you and you'll have the opportunity to socialize with other equally minded people.<br>&nbsp;<br>We are looking forward to welcome you!</p>
<h3>Agenda</h3>
<p>08:00 - 08:30: Early start (with koffiekoeken for you!)<br>08:30 - 09:00: Kick-off (rules, teaming, minimal requirements)<br>09:00 - 12:30: Code, code, code!<br>13:00 - 13:30: Demo your app and cloud service<br>13:30 - 17:30: Barbeque time!</p>
<h3>Support</h3>
<p>Two user groups, a bunch of MVP's and MEET members... If you need help with anything, just ask! We'll be doing demo's around 08:30, 10:00 and 11:30 as well.</p>

<p><strong>We've had a lot of no-shows earlier. Which is a pity if we order sandwiches, but even more of a pity if we have to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">slaughter cattle</span> provide meat and afterwards throw it in the garbage can.</strong><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Here's the deal: you pay us 10 EUR now and if you show up, you simply get it back. Making it a free event for you if you show up. Fair enough?</span></strong></p>
