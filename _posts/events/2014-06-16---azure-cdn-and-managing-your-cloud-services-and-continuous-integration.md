<p>Want to learn about the Azure CDN? This is your chance! And of course we need a way to manage and deploy our applications as well... In this evening, Maarten and Kurt will guide you through these topics.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;">Session info</span></p>
<h3>Reducing latency on the web with the Azure CDN</h3>
<p>Serving up content on the Internet is something our web sites do daily. But are we doing this in the fastest way possible? How are users in faraway countries experiencing our apps? Why do we have three webservers serving the same content over and over again? In this session, we&rsquo;ll explore the Azure Content Delivery Network or CDN, a service which makes it easy to serve up blobs, videos and other content from servers close to our users. We&rsquo;ll explore simple file serving as well as some more advanced, dynamic edge caching scenarios.</p>

<h3>Managing your Cloud Services + Continuous Integration solutions</h3>
<p>Deploying your Azure solution is only a first step. Once in production you&rsquo;ll need a way to manage the deployed service. You&rsquo;ll want to gather performance diagnostics, create and read logfiles, monitor the use of your databases, (re)deploy the service automated, swap between staging and production, scale out extra instances &hellip; This is possible through the portal of course, but we need a more automated way to manage everything. Azure has some management and diagnostics API&rsquo;s, SQL Azure has management views, Storage has a logging API,&hellip; &nbsp;Let's dive in these. In this talk we share an overview of the different API&rsquo;s and how to use them. You&rsquo;ll also be happy to see a demo of some management tool I&rsquo;ve build that integrates into TFS for continuous integration.</p>
