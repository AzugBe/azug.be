### Building a Large Scale Real World Application on a Coffee Budget
The promise of “the cloud” is that you can get as much as you want, when you want it, and only pay for what you use. The cloud sets expectations of provisioning resources at the drop of a hat in a way we could previously only dream of. But is that the reality? And how much do you pay for all this? And for that matter, what’s stopping costs from spiralling out of control?

I’ll take you through how I built ‘Have I Been Pwned” which manages millions of visitors per day searching billions of records. You’ll see how Azure’s PaaS features have been used to build a highly scalable website that’s literally run on a coffee budget. This includes Azure’s App Service, SQL Database, WebJobs, VMs and Functions, all working in unison to bring the promise of the cloud to reality. You’ll also see how Azure can be complimented with external services such as Cloudflare to ensure resilience against extreme bursts of unexpected traffic.

It’s a practical look at a real world Azure success story that will answer many of the questions people have about moving to the cloud.
