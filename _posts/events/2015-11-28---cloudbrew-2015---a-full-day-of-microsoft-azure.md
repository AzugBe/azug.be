<h2><strong>Microsoft Azure</strong></h2>
<p>A full day of Microsoft Azure! We will have some local and international speakers who will share their knowledge and experience. Two tracks,&nbsp;6 sessions each.</p>
<h2><strong>Beer sampling</strong></h2>
<p>The event will take place <a href="https://www.craywinckelhof.be/">at a brewery</a>! We'll have warm lunch (3 courses) and a guided brewery tour and beer tasting. But no worries! We'll have plenty of coffee and soda, too.</p>
<h2><strong>Small scale</strong></h2>
<p>We intentionally keep CloudBrew small-scale. This gives the event a more intimate feeling. It also allows us to keep the cost low, providing a day of learning that's really worth everyone's valuable time.</p>
<h2><strong>Community</strong></h2>
<p>Organized by <a href="/">AZUG</a>, the Belgium Microsoft Azure User Group, CloudBrew originates from the community. Both you and our speakers are part of it. Ideal to network with peers!</p>
