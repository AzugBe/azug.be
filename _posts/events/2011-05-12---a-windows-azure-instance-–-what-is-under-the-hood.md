<h2>Session info</h2>
<p>Did you ever wonder what is going on inside an instance of Windows Azure? How does it get the notification from the Fabric controller? How do they communicate and what kind of messages they exchange? Is it all native or there is a managed part? We&rsquo;ll make a quick overview of what an instance is, what is happening when you click the deploy button and there proceed to an anatomy.. This is a highly technical hardcore session including tracing, debugging and tons of geekiness. Very few slides, lots of live demos.</p>
