## Sessions

### Securing Microsoft Azure’s assets
In the cloud no one can hear you scream… or can they. Even though Microsoft has a tremendous army of gadgets (besides the sharks with freakin lasers that is) in place for defending your environments, sometimes you need that additional little thing. The goal of the session is to provide you some guidance and an overview of Azure’s security measures, either out of the box activated or the additional ones you can foresee. Next to that you’ll get an idea on how to monitor and react to threats that have been noticed or unnoticed. Expect some PowerShell, Azure architecture, and service tweaks which can help you settle at ease in your new condominium with panic room.

He’s been active in the IT industry for over 17 years and has performed almost all types of job profiles, going from coaching and leading a team to architecting and systems design and training. Today he’s primarily into the Microsoft Cloud Platform and Application Lifecycle Management. He’s not a stranger to both dev and IT Pro topics, they even call him the perfect hybrid solution. In January 2012 he became a crew member of AZUG, the Belgian Microsoft Azure User Group. As an active member he’s both involved in giving presentations and organizing events. Mike is also a Microsoft Azure MVP (already awarded 4 times, working on his fifth) and Microsoft Azure Advisor. Helping out in the community and introducing new & young people into the world of Microsoft and technology is also one of his passions.*
