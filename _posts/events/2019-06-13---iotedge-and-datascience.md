Want to learn everything about going into production with IoT Edge and Data Science? Join this session and learn all about it.

## Agenda

### Data Science in Production

Build, Train and Operationalize your Machine Learning models using Azure Databricks and Azure ML Services. 

In this session, they take preparing data and building a machine learning model in Azure databricks a step further. 
How can you effectively do model management and versioning? How can you deploy this model to production without being a system engineer? 
How do you monitor and manage our deployed model without being a DevOps engineer?

### Going into production: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly of Azure IoT Edge

Azure IoT Edge is the perfect IoT solution when sensors are not allowed to connect to the cloud, the amount of IoT messages sent must be limited, a local feedback loop to actuators is needed, etc.

Yes, it has all the right features pull this off. But it’s still a long way from the first successful POC and pilot to production.
This presentation introduces you to the various encountered pitfalls and principles of common IoT Projects.

Sander will highlight the most common challenges he experienced during several IoT Edge projects, how to avoid them and he will introduce a more mature way of looking about your IoT solutions.

Attendees will learn the most important concepts of a successful IoT Project in this interactive session.

IoT Hubs, IoT Edge, Stream Analytics, Azure Functions, Mobile Apps, EventHubs, Universal Apps, etc) and Azure in general. He started as an IT consultant in 1993. He likes to gets his hands dirty with software innovations and he tries to implement these in his daily work. For Sander, it is important to share knowledge. And he is committed doing so by writing blogs, articles for magazines and giving lots of presentations. When offline, he likes cutting down trees using Gränsfors Bruks axes, sailing, motorcycling or geocaching with his wife and sons.
