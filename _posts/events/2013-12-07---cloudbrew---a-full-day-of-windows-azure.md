<p><span style="font-size: large;">Windows Azure</span></p>
<p>A full day of Windows Azure! We have some local speakers as well as speakers from abroad who will share their knowledge. Two tracks, 4 sessions each.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Beer and dinner</span></p>
<p>The event will take place <a href="https://www.hetanker.be">at a brewery</a>! We'll have one session slot with a guided brewery tour and beer tasting. The day will end with beers and dinner with attendees.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Community</span></p>
<p>Organized by AZUG, the Belgium Windows Azure User Group, CloudBrew originates from the community. Both you and our speakers are part of it. Ideal to network with peers!</p>
<h2>CloudBrew 2013 was a blast!</h2>
