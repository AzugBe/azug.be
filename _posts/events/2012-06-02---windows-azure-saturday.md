<p><strong>We've had a lot of no-shows earlier. Which is a pity if we order sandwiches, but even more of a pity if we have to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">slaughter cattle</span> provide meat and afterwards throw it in the garbage can.</strong><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Here's the deal: you pay us 10 EUR now and if you show up, you simply get it back. Making it basically a free event for you. Fair enough?</span></strong></p>
