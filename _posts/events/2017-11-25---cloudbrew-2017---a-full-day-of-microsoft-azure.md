## Microsoft Azure
A full day of Microsoft Azure! We will have some local and international speakers who will share their knowledge and experience. Two tracks and lots of sessions!

## Beer sampling
The event takes place <a href="http://lamot-mechelen.be/">in a former brewery</a>. We'll have a lunch buffet and some beers. But no worries! We'll have plenty of coffee and soda, too.

## Small scale
We intentionally keep CloudBrew small-scale. This gives the event a more intimate feeling. It also allows us to keep the cost low, providing a day of learning that's really worth everyone's valuable time.

## Community

Organized by AZUG, the Belgium Microsoft Azure User Group, CloudBrew originates from the community. Both you and our speakers are part of it. Ideal to network with peers!
