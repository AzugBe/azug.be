In our last session of the year we welcome both Jan and Geert. We hope by then you will be recovered from CloudBrew and are ready for an evening packed with their experiences.

Be sure to make it on time as a little bird told us there is a Pizza truck as from 18h sharp!

## Agenda

### DataOps on Azure: treat your data as code!

DataOps is a derivative from the DevOps principle which is taking the IT world by storm. In this session I will show you how to apply DataOps on top of an Azure-based analytical workload.

Jan loved it for the premise of a fully computerized environment. After building some of the movies 'Unix system' interfaces in the BASIC programming language, the passion for IT was sparked. The sense of wonder induced by that movie is something that Jan tries to pass on to every person he meets.

### Supercharge your AKS deployments with GitOps and Flux v2

Flux set the standard for GitOps so it came as no surprise when Microsoft integrated the solution in Azure Arc and AKS.

In this session, we will look at Flux v2 and its tight integration with Azure. We will look at best practices around structuring your git repositories, managing your deployments, and handling secrets. With GitOps you will supercharge your deployments to your Kubernetes clusters, wherever they are running.
