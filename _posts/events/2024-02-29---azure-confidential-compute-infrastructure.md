## Agenda

### Azure Confidential Computing: The Key to Unlocking the Cloud for Your Most Sensitive Workloads

<img src="/assets/media/speakers/jan-gezels.jpg" alt="Jan Gezels" align="right" height="100" width="100" style="margin-right: 20px;">Azure Confidential Computing is a cutting-edge technology that enables you to run your most sensitive workloads in the cloud with even greater security. By using hardware-based trusted execution environments to encrypt data in use, Azure Confidential Computing ensures that your data is protected from unauthorized access, even by cloud providers and administrators. This means that you can confidently move your most strict workloads to the cloud, knowing that your data is always secure. With Azure Confidential Computing, you can unlock the full potential of the cloud for your most sensitive workloads.

### Bridging On-Premises and Azure: handling the struggles of a hybrid azure environment

Setting up a hybrid environment presents its own set of challenges, with DNS serving as a cornerstone for infrastructure stability. Achieving seamless resolution between on-premises and Azure DNS zones is crucial. While historically, many applications were hosted on-premises, there's been a recent trend of migrating them to Azure. Despite this shift, maintaining a standardized authentication method remains essential. Leveraging Entra ID authentication can provide a uniform login experience for both on-premises and Azure applications, enabling the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for on-premises applications as well. Entra-ID has it's limitations with nested groups (enterprise-applications) what are the options and how can we get rid of this painfull issue?
