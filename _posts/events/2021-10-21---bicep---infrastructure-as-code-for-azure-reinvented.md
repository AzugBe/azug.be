## Agenda

### Bicep - Infrastructure as Code for Azure Reinvented

In a fast-moving software project, the demands that your application poses on its infrastructure might change often and drastically. Are you also fed up with having to apply infrastructure changes by hand? Not to worry! In Azure, there is the Azure Resource Manager, a unified API for managing all your Azure services in a declarative style, and a new more powerful templating language: Bicep!

In this session, Henry Been will give you a full tour of Bicep templates. Starting from scratch, we will explore how you can set up an architecture that is ready for deployment of your application code. We will touch upon syntax, manual deployment, and more advanced features as nesting templates, authorizations, and policies.
