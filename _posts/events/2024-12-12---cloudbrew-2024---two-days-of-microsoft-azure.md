A two-day conference by AZUG, the Belgium Microsoft Azure User Group on Thursday, December 12, 2024 - Friday, December 13, 2024.

## Microsoft Azure

Two full days of Microsoft Azure! We will have some local and international speakers who will share their knowledge and experience.

## Great lunch

The event takes place in a former brewery. A lunch buffet will take care of our inner selves. After all, brains that learn need energy!

## Small scale

We try to balance the size of CloudBrew to give the event a more intimate feeling, where everyone is approachable - attendees and speakers. A day of learning that's really worth everyone's valuable time.

## Community

Organized by AZUG, the Belgium Microsoft Azure User Group, CloudBrew originates from the community. Both you and our speakers are part of it. Ideal to network with peers!
