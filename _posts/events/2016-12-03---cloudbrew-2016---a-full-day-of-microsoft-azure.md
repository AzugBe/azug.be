<p><strong>Microsoft Azure</strong></p>
<p>A full day of Microsoft Azure! We will have some local and international speakers who will share their knowledge and experience. Two tracks,&nbsp;5 sessions each.</p>
<p><strong>Beer sampling</strong></p>
<p>The event takes place <a href="https://lamot-mechelen.be/">in a former brewery</a>. We'll have a lunch buffet, and&nbsp;a session dedicated to sampling&nbsp;beer. But no worries! We'll have plenty of coffee and soda, too.</p>
<p><strong>Small scale</strong></p>
<p>We intentionally keep CloudBrew small-scale. This gives the event a more intimate feeling. It also allows us to keep the cost low, providing a day of learning that's really worth everyone's valuable time.</p>
<p><strong>Community</strong></p>
<p>Organized by <a href="/">AZUG</a>, the Belgium Microsoft Azure User Group, CloudBrew originates from the community. Both you and our speakers are part of it. Ideal to network with peers!</p>
