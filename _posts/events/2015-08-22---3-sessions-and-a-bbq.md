<h3><img src="/assets/media/speakers/kurt-claeys2.jpg" alt="" align="right" width="125" height="125">Authenticating Mobile Apps through Windows Azure Active Directory</h3>
<p><em>Windows Azure Active Directory is a cloud based credential store offering a perfect solution for authenticating mobile users to access you web API. In this session we see how Windows Azure Active Directory (WAAD for short) works, what kind of users we can store, how to get an access token in W8 and Xamarin (iOS and Android) apps using the Azure Active Directory Authentication Library (ADAL for short), how to send the token to the API, what&rsquo;s use of a refresh token, how the OWIN based API uses the token to fill up the ClaimsPrincipal, how to access the claims in the backend, how to deal with group based authorization, how to get more metadata about the user, how to use 2 Factor Authentication and how to automate user and group management through the Azure AD Graph API. This session will not only be a nice Azure/W8/Xamarin showcase but will also focus on the concepts of federated Identity in general.</em></p>
<p>Speaker: Kurt Claeys (MCT, Azure Certified Technology Specialist, .NET MVP and Xamarin Certified Mobile Developer) is a freelance Azure/Xamarin architect at <a href="http://www.nuboid.com">www.nuboid.com</a></p>
<h3><img src="/assets/media/speakers/yves-goeleven.jpg" alt="" align="right" width="100" height="150">Azure Service Fabric, Next generation Platform as a Service</h3>
<p><em>For years we&rsquo;ve been in a love/hate relationship with existing PaaS services like Cloud Services and App Services. Both models have great capabilities, but also great shortcomings. Azure Service Fabric is a new member of the PaaS family that promises to keep the good parts and fix the shortcomings. In this session, I will take you on a tour around this new service and it&rsquo;s capabilities.</em></p>

<h3><img src="/assets/media/speakers/maarten-200x200.jpg" alt="" align="right" width="125" height="125">Get more than a cache back! The Microsoft Azure (Redis) Cache</h3>
<p><em>The Microsoft Azure Redis Cache must be the fourth or fifth generation of a hosted cache service on Azure. This time, an open-source solution has been embraced: Redis. In this session, we&rsquo;ll see that it&rsquo;s more than just an in-memory cache system we can use in our applications. Let&rsquo;s explore what Redis is, what the different data types are and why we should care. And once we grasp how Redis stores its stuff, we&rsquo;ll delve into how we can use it to its fullest extent: searching the key-value store, transactions, pub/sub support and scripting.</em></p>

<p><strong>We've had a lot of no-shows earlier. Which is a pity if we order sandwiches, but even more of a pity if we have to <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">slaughter cattle</span> provide meat and afterwards throw it in the garbage can.</strong><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Here's the deal: you pay us 10 EUR now and if you show up, you simply get it back. Making it basically a free event for you. Fair enough?</span></strong></p>
