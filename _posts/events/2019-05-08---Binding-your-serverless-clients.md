## Agenda

### Binding your serverless clients

Scaling your services to hundreds of instances without breaking a sweat is probably the main reason you want to develop a serverless solution. But what about connecting to services which aren't supported out of the box? Are you creating your own `HttpClient`, `SqlConnection` or connecting via some obscure third-party client? â€¯

During this session, I'll be covering how you can create your own Azure Function custom binding types.

By using these custom binding types you can reuse them all over your solution, use some of the best practices for each binding type and make sure your Azure Functions can interact and scale to any service with ease!

If you want to create a production-ready serverless solution, be sure to attend this session!
