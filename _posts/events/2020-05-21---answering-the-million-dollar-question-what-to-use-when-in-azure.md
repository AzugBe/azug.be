Azure has grown to a cloud platform of more than 100+ services, but when do you use what?! Barry will guide the way!

## Agenda

### Answering the million dollar question: What to use when in Azure?

In this session, I demystify the purpose of the services in Azure that are meant for developers. I'll tell you which ones are meant for which scenarios, so that you know how to pick the ones that fit your needs. Amongst many other things, you'll learn the differences between the options for hosting your applications in Azure and what you need to look for when deciding on a data store in Azure. You'll learn how to pick the right services for speeding up your application and what you should use to monitor your application.

In short, this session answers the question that everybody wants an answer to: Which Azure services should I use for my scenario?
