<p>How would you go about designing a cloud-scale database of a couple of terabytes? We're not sure about that... and that's why Scott Klein, Technical Evangelist on Windows Azure SQL Database, will come and explain us!</p>
<h2>Session info</h2>
<p><strong>Windows Azure SQL Federation: Scaling your cloud database and building cross-federation queries and other tips</strong></p>
<p>Windows Azure SQL Federation enables the building of large scale solutions on SQL Database. We&rsquo;ll cover the best practices and patterns for building database tiers with best of breed scalability with databases stretched over to hundreds of nodes and with TBs of data and with thousands of concurrent users in the cloud. We cover issues such as scale-first database design practices and designing fan-out queries and dealing with identity generation. We&rsquo;ll look at architecting systems that need to go beyond the capacity of a single node in the cloud, systems that need to handle spikes and bursts, or systems with multi-tenancy and elasticity for great economics.</p>
