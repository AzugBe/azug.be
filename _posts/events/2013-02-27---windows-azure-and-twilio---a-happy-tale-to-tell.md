<p>Did you know Windows Azure has a connection to that other cloud? You can make phone calls from the cloud! In this session, Panagiotis will dive into a project he's currently working on: building a virtual callcenter using Windows Azure and some interesting API's!</p>
<h2>Session info</h2>
<h3>Windows Azure and Twilio - A happy tale to tell</h3>
<p>Taking advantage of Twilio&rsquo;s awesomeness and Windows Azure&rsquo;s scalability, we decided to build call center in the cloud. It was finished with some salt from ASP.NET MVC Web API and bonded with SignalR. The end result was tasty and I&rsquo;m here to share the tale and the recipe of creating a highly scalable call center solution using only cloud services.</p>
