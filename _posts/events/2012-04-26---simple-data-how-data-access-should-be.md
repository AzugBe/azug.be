<h3>Simple Data: How Data Access Should Be</h3>
<p>Ever struggled with accessing data from a database? Do you also think too much code and work is needed to perform simple data access operations? Then this session will show you the light and impress you with how easy data access can be, and how the same mechanism can be used to access data in the most common RDBMS engines, but also in no-sql based data stores like Windows Azure Table Storage.</p>
<p>Simple Data is a light weight, dynamic data access component for .NET, written in C# and inspired by Ruby&rsquo;s ActiveRecord and DataMapper. It is easy-to-use, ensures consistency, prevents SQL injection attacks and doesn&rsquo;t require a lot of boilerplate ADO.NET code or ORM models. Simple Data succeeds in this by using the dynamic features of .NET 4 to interpret method and property names at runtime and map them to the underlying data-store with a convention based approach. Most of the data access code can even be written in a single and easy readable line of code.</p>
<p>That is how data access should be: easy, flexible and short.</p>
