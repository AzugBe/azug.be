The cloud offers many treasures for those who dare to fully embrace it. But how do you start this journey, and how to get to your destination? Thomas Vandaele will cover moving on-premise TFS to a modern DevOps pipeline, Jan Van Meirvenne and Lorenz Pensaert will dive into cloud-native applications.

## Agenda

### From TFS trenches to DevOps modern warfare at LoQutus

At LoQutus we've moved from several on-premise TFS servers (spanning several versions) to Azure DevOps over the past 2 years. We've also helped several clients in setting up or moving to a DevOps environment.

In this talk we'll discuss how we migrated from TFVC to git, how this has impacted the development process for us and our clients and how we've incrementally adopted several DevOps features to aid our project delivery process. CI builds, deployments, release notes - all automated through the power of Azure Pipelines!

Expect a lot of lessons learned and practical advice to help you on your own journey to DevOps.

He is adamant about keeping an open mind when selecting a technology stack, but finds himself being able to rely on the .NET and Azure stack for many projects. At LoQutus, he is currently working as a senior developer for clients, while also taking up the role of guild master for the Azure/.NET guild.*

### The roadmap towards cloud-native applications

The cloud offers many treasures for those who dare to fully embrace it. But how do you start this journey, and how to get to your destination?

In this session we will show you how to transform platforms, people and processes to crawl, step and in the end, sprint towards a modern, cloud-native application environment.

Projects with a complex requirement or problem give him the possibility to outdo himself . Envisioning an elegant solution and making difficult things look simple is a core principle he uses for every project. This makes it easier for both the customer’s and his life. Jan is definitely not a one trick pony. Due to his background as an IT Pro and Developer he is able to provide his clients a versatile skillset. Not only can he offer an off-the-shelf solution, but if possible he can also make it as tailored to the customer’s requirements as needed.*

The areas that interest him the most are software development, the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and Cloud solutions. Lorenz is a very analytical & creative person who loves solving difficult problems in team or by himself.*

*During his spare time Lorenz also has a web development company which specializes in the development of custom-built project management applications. As a developer Lorenz prefers the .NET C# programming environment, but he also has quite the experience with Angular, Java, Assembler, Python and Unity.*
