In our third session of the year, we'll have two session that focus on building solutions with Azure PaaS. See you there?

## Agenda

### Jumping straight into code when building your Azure PaaS product… will it fizz or will it bang?

About a year ago we felt the urge to build a product to make our Zure booth at the CloudBrew conference stand out. 

Not much later, we came up with the idea of building Zpeedy, our own IoT-powered racetrack. 

We dove right into different technical scenarios as Azure PaaS fans, but it soon became clear that we needed some business context to keep us on track during our journey…

This session will sum up how we went through the various product development stages. You'll get some tips and tricks on how to do just-enough-analysis, and we'll look at which Azure PaaS components we used, why we chose them, and what lessons we learned along the way.

Come join us if you want to find out what's under the hood of Zpeedy or if you just want to race your heart out!

### Building intelligent vessels that navigate the world's oceans.

Codit recently worked with the leading crude oil carrier Euronav, helping them connecting their vessels to the shore. 
Euronav wants to reduce their carbon footprint and become net-zero by 2050.  

To achieve that goal, Euronav has setup the 'FAST' platform.
This software platform is build on Azure and collects telemetry from the vessels.  Euronav uses the collected information to optimize vessel fuel consumption and performance. Next to that, FAST is also a primary tool for the crew on board of the vessel for their day-to-day operations. The platform is used to exchange information between vessel and shore, getting insights in the performance of the vessel etc...

In this talk, you’ll get insights on how we used various Azure services like IoT Edge, Azure Arc, Azure Connected Container Registry to build and deploy this platform
