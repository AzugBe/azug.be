<p><img alt="" align="left" src="/assets/media/Event/rabbit.png" width="200" height="150">After watching the BUILD keynote together, it should be clear that the cloud plays a big role in the future. Let Yves guide you in a world-wide journey of building highly-scalable, highly-available and geographically distributed systems on Windows Azure.</p>
<h2>Session info</h2>
<p>Public websites and applications are like rabbits, when you release them into the wild they either scale very fast or end up as road kill because of excessive traffic. In this talk I will introduce you to all the features available in the Windows Azure Platform that can help you build really scalable online applications.<img alt="" align="right" src="/assets/media/speakers/yves-goeleven.jpg" width="100" height="150"></p>
