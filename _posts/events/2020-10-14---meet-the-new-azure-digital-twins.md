### Meet the new Azure Digital Twins

As announced at Microsoft Build 2020, Azure Digital Twins has a new public preview. Azure Digital Twins allow customer to create rich models that allows optimizations of the general flow of business.

For this session we are excited to have Christopher from the EMEA IoT & Edge computing team joining us.

Digital Twins is a platform for developers to model the real world, controlled using a rich set of REST APIs and C# SDK.
In this session, we are going through all the new capabilities of the new Azure Digital Twin platform. Glenn & Christopher will show you how to model your Digital Twin Graph and use the live execution environment to create a rich eco system for your IoT data processing.

Attendees will learn when and how Azure Digital Twins is ideal for their IoT solution. Making sure they are ready to build the next generation of IoT platforms.
