AZUG is proud to be part of the Global AI March 2024. We are hosting the Belgium chapter of this global event in Mechelen.

Unfortunately we had to cancel this event due to the low attendance/interest for this particular day which could not justify the cost of renting the building, catering and drinks. We will reschedule this event so be sure to follow azug.be and subscribe to our newsletter.
