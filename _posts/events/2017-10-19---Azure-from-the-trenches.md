## Sessions
### Azure from the trenches
The day had come. A project where cloud was up front and central. My prayers had been answered. I could leave the enterprison behind and choose all of the components! Life was good.

Except... there were these pesky requirements which impacted the design my team had come up with. Even more worrying: not every component behaved as we expected. How could we bend everything to our will, or were we the ones that had to bend?”

In this session you will hear about one of my latest projects, the challenges faced and the solutions built. I’ll share my experience on: .net core, SPA’s with Angular 4, leveraging VSTS to roll out and update environments dynamically, integrating and automating Azure AD to secure applications and much more.
