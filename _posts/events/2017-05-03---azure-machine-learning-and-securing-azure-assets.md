Hello Customer is happy to host an event in the Ghelacomo arena to talk about finding nuggets with Azure Machine Learning (ML) Studio and Mike Marting will talk about how and where azure security works and what you can do to secure your Azure resources.

## Sessions
### Finding nuggets with Azure ML Studio
Currently there are not a lot of point-and-click data science tools, Azure ML Studio is among the first with a very specific offering. During this session we will make a text analysis exercise on azure ml studio and see where the pitfalls are. After the exercise we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using Azure ML Studio.

### Enter The Matrix: Securing Azure's Assets
In the cloud no one can hear you scream… or can they. Even though Microsoft has a tremendous army of gadgets *(besides the sharks with freakin lasers that is)* in place for defending your environments, sometimes you need that additional little thing.

The goal of the session is to provide you some guidance and an overview of Azure’s security measures, either out of the box activated or the additional ones you can foresee.

Next to that you’ll get an idea on how to monitor and react to threats that have been noticed or unnoticed. Expect some PowerShell, Azure architecture, and service tweaks which can help you settle at ease in your new condominium with panic room.
