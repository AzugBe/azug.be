<h3>Loads of new features in Azure &hellip; let&rsquo;s have a horizontal look at them</h3>
<p>It looks like Azure is expanding in many directions : web, mobile, data-analytics, backup, media, remote desktop, API management, document databases, search, cache &hellip;. In this session we&rsquo;ll see a brief overview of these new technologies so we can still see the big picture and understand where Azure is heading to.</p>

<h3>Cool NoSQL on Azure with DocumentDB</h3>
<p><em>DocumentDB is the latest NoSQL storage option released to Azure. In this session you will learn what DocumentDB is, what features it contains, how it is different to other storage solutions and in what kind of situations you should/could use it.
