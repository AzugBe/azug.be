<p>Join us on May 5th for two sessions that apply to anyone using Azure's SaaS and IaaS services. Tom Kerkhove will show us what the Azure Key Vault is about and how it can help us keep secrets a secret. Aleksandar Nikolic joins us for a session around automating common Azure IaaS management tasks.</p>
<h2>Securing sensitive data with Azure Key Vault</h2>
<p>As a developer you often have to use &amp; store a lot of sensitive data going from service credentials to connection strings or even encryption keys. But how do I store these in a secure way? How do I know who has access to them and how do I prevent people from copying them and abusing them? On the other hand, SaaS customers have no clue how you store their sensitive data and how they use it. How can they monitor that? How can they revoke your access easily?</p>
<p>In this session I&rsquo;ll guide you to securely store keys, credentials and other secrets in the cloud with Azure Key Vault. You will also see that SaaS customers are still the owners of their sensitive data and can monitor everything.</p>

<h2>Automating common Azure IaaS management tasks</h2>
<p>When you want to manage repetitive Azure IaaS tasks and processes efficiently, Azure Portal is not good enough. You cannot even perform some of the tasks in a portal. We will talk about how to use PowerShell and PowerShell Workflow-based Azure Automation to automate tasks in Azure. With automation, IT costs can be reduced and efficient deployments are made possible.</p>
