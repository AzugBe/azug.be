<p>Let&rsquo;s explore what Windows 8, WinRT and Windows Azure can do together. Let&rsquo;s explore how you can publish your application and how you can get live diagnostics from your users. Dive into push notifications and modern slavery in the form of worker roles in this evening filled with two practical sessions!&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Session info</h2>
<h3>Taking a metro ride on Windows 8 and Windows Azure</h3>
<p>With the upcoming release of Windows 8 and new interesting technologies like WinRT and Metro, it is time to check out the possibilities these bring in combination with Windows Azure.<br>In one evening but with two different sessions you will be immersed into the future of these promising and versatile technologies.</p>
<p>In the first session we will talk about the new Windows Store, management of licenses, we will go through the certification process and discuss how to get an application published.<br>By using an external application or custom code on Windows Azure, we will perform diagnostics on the application and demonstrate how to manage information from within.<br>The sauce on top will be a nice Metro UI, ready to be touched on a Windows 8 tablet and fully integrated with Windows Azure by using the notification services.</p>
<p>In the second session, we will work through an application using Windows Azure as a backend for data and processing. Somewhere in the cloud, a worker will be reading and processing broadcast information and storing it on storage. Once new information is available and stored, the notification services will inform the clients about it.<br>Using a nicely designed Metro client, this broadcast data will be visualized in a touch enabled TV guide running on a Windows 8 tablet.</p>
