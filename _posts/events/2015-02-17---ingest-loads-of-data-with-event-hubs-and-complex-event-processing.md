<p>Two sessions, one evening. Sam Vanhoutte will take us along on an overview of Azure Event Hubs and what they can do for us. We'll also see how we can do complex event processing on Azure and what toosl are available.</p>
<h2>Ingest loads of data with Azure Event Hubs</h2>
<p>In this session, Sam will give an overview of Azure Service Bus Event Hubs. &nbsp;He will talk about the concepts, the technical usage and the scenarios in which Event Hubs can be used. &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Complex Event Processing on Azure</h2>
<p>While more data is being produced on a daily basis, there is often the need to get insights in the big stream of this data events. Telemetry data from devices, tracing information or click events from your web site, traffic information... All these events are typically sent in a large stream of data.</p>
<p>With the Azure platform, there are several services that allow to get real time analytics from that stream. Azure Stream Analytics, Event Hubs and other services can be used to learn from your data.</p>
<p>In this session, Sam will give an overview of Complex Event Processing on Azure, using various demos and scenarios.</p>
