Microsoft has in the mean time already developed a lot of Copilots in various of their products. All these Copilots are based on the Sementic Kernel framework allowing them to build flexible assisent which can answer questions for end users. Within this sesseon, we will cover the basic of Sementic kernel with the runner, plugins, etc. and look at some demo's and how you can intgrated you own plugin into the exsiting Microsoft Copilots.

### Castle in the Cloud: Azure network perimeter defense

In the cloud you want to protect everything with Identity! Although not untrue we still see many developments in technologies like the Azure Application Gateway and the Azure Firewall. Having all PaaS resources publicly available is not preferred according to current best practices in security. So IT environments are moving back to a more perimeter focused defense where only a couple of points are connected to the wider internet.

During this talk you will learn how to use the application gateway and azure firewall to protect the connected points. You will also learn how to make sure zero trust principles can be applied internally to make a network which is secure and in control. So if you want to develop a strong defense in the cloud using the most modern techniques then join this session!

**Speaker:  Leo Visser** Microsoft MVP & Cloud Consultant @ OGD.
