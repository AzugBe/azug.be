<p>On this last day of October, we will have Nuno Godinho over, bringing us two sessions:&nbsp;Windows Azure Active Directory and Real-Time Applications. As a Director of Cloud Services at <a href="https://www.aditi.com">Aditi</a>, he has several years of experience working on various Windows Azure projects. Join us and Nuno and learn about some real-world experiences and technical approaches to solving things.</p>
<h2>Session info</h2>
<p><strong>Windows Azure Active Directory</strong><br>Windows Azure Active Directory is a very important part of the Windows Azure platform since it provides a way to manage your identity and also connect to existing Active Directory infrastructures. In this session we will be covering the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration between Windows Azure Active Directory and Office 365</li>
<li>GraphAPI</li>
<li>WebSSO</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Real-time Data Management in the Cloud</strong><br>Everyone is currently talking about Big Data problems and always think about technologies like Hadoop, Elastic MR and so on, but all those are done for data analytics not in real-time. When we think about real-time systems like CCTV analysis for disturbances, Financial Markets, Manufacturing with real-time adjustments of the production everything becomes different. In this session, we will be talking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is Real-time and when should I care?</li>
<li>Scenarios where it might fit</li>
<li>Event Driven Architectures</li>
<li>How Cloud can help getting real-time solutions</li>
<li>What products/frameworks can help? (NServiceBus,&nbsp;NESPER,&nbsp;MessageHandler,&nbsp;Reactive Extensions, ...)</li>
</ul>
