<h3>Lost in translation - How Azure Networking is different.</h3>
<p>As one of the major cloud providers Microsoft Azure has a big adoption rate in a lot of businesses around the world. Customers are moving parts of their infrastructure from their own datacenter(s) to the Azure Cloud. Developers, system engineers, network engineers and security staff are all effected by this change. On premise network engineers have been building secure networks for years. Obviously they want to extend and reuse this knowledge in the cloud. They are talking about network firewalls, network segmentation, vlan&rsquo;s. However in the Azure cloud this is slightly different and some of the trusted mechanism are unavailable. In this talk we go in-depth on the various Azure networking options and how establish secure connectivity between Azure and various on-premise locations.</p>
