<p>Many people told us they would prefer having two sessions on one evening so let's try that! We have Mike Martin diving into Windows Azure Media Services. We also have Patriek van Dorp, with a session about managing Windows Azure using PowerShell and making life easier that way.</p>
<h2>Session info</h2>
<h3>Lights, Camera, Action - Windows Azure Media Services on the Loose</h3>
<p>You just cannot imagine the Web without audio and video services. Up until now, if you want to include streaming media content in your websites or applications, you need to rely on third party services or massive computing capacity for media transcoding, and streaming to a range of client devices. With the release of Windows Azure Media Services and the Media Services SDK, these capabilities are becoming easily available for you to incorporate in your websites and applications. In this session we'll give an overview of Windows Azure Media Services, and you'll learn from a series of demos how you can take advantage of the platform to add media content to your development. We'll also see what the competition has in store and what's missing.</p>
<p><em><img width="100" align="right" alt="Mike Martin" src="/assets/media/speakers/mike-martin.jpg">Speaker:&nbsp;</em><i><a href="https://techmike2kx.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Mike</a>&nbsp;is Microsoft Lead Consultant and Architect at Crosspoint Solutions (part of the Cronos group), a company with a strong focus on BI, Data and CRM. Mike is mainly focused on the complete Microsoft product stack and therefore very flexible to work with. He&rsquo;s been active in the IT industry for over 15 years and has performed almost all types of job profiles, going from coaching and leading a team to architecting and systems design and training. Today he&rsquo;s primarily into the Microsoft Cloud Platform and Application Lifecycle Management. He&rsquo;s not a stranger to both dev and IT Pro topics.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>In January 2012 he became a crew member of AZUG, the Belgian Windows Azure User Group. As an active member he&rsquo;s both involved in giving presentations and organizing events. Mike is also a Windows Azure MVP and Windows Azure Insider.&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>Mike likes helping out in the community and introducing new &amp; young people into the world of Microsoft and technology.</i></p>
<h3>Gain Productivity in Managing Windows Azure Resources Using PowerShell</h3>
<p>As we see our customer demand shift from occasional development or migration of silo applications to integrated Cloud solutions and even entire datacenter migrations, managing our Cloud resources becomes a nightmare. This session will show how to take control and regain productivity in managing those large scale Windows Azure solutions using Windows (Azure) PowerShell.</p>
<p><em><img width="100" align="right" alt="Patriek van Dorp" src="/assets/media/speakers/patriek-van-dorp.jpg"></em></p>
<p><i>Speaker: <a href="https://onwindowsazure.com/" target="_blank">Patriek van Dorp</a> - As a Technology Consultant at Sogeti in The Netherlands, I'm passionate about helping businesses grow by using the right technologies. I'm an expert in designing and implementing complex Cloud Computing solutions for the Enterprise using Microsoft's Cloud platform, Windows Azure. As I started my IT career as a Systems Engineer I've worked in Operations for several years before I re-educated to become a Software Engineer. This enables me to bridge the gap between IT Operations and Development and produce well integrated Enterprise solutions. Three years ago I co-founded the Dutch Windows Azure User Group (WAZUGNL) and I'm a regular speaker at community events and conferences in The Netherlands and abroad. I have been rewarded the Microsoft MVP award for three years in a row now.</i></p>
