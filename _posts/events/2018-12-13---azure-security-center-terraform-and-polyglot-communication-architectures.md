## Agenda

### Stay Safe with Azure Security Center
Azure Security Center offers unified security management and advanced threat protection across hybrid cloud workloads.
All of your Azure and on-prem workloads are continuously monitored to help find and remediate any vulnerabilities quickly. 
Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph helps you to respond to continuously changing and improving cyber attacks. 
With adaptive application controls and Just in time access you can protect your environment from various threats.
 
This session will cover the security features baked into the Azure platform to help you keep your environment safe.

### As an Azure user, should I switch to Terraform?
One year ago, Microsoft reinforced their partnership with Hashicorp especially around Terraform, their resource management tool that gets a growing traction within the Cloud community. 
Where are we one year later? How good is Terraform for Azure users? Should you adopt it? How does it compare to ARM templates?

This talk will give you a glimpse of the Terraform ecosystem and how it integrates with Azure. 
We will also talk about philosophy behind Terraform, the moving parts involved and the main usecases. 
Terraform uses a declarative syntax to request resources and allocates them statefully, which is a game changer. Real life examples will be demonstrated live during the talk.

This talk is for you if you want to know more about Terraform or if you still wonder if Terraform should be your next DevOps Azure move.
