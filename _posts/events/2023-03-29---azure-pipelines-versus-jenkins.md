In our second session of the year, we'll have a look at Azure pipelines versus Jenkins. And as an a second topic we will discuss Azure Load Testing in "There are too many of them! What are we going to do?", so 2 for the price of 1! See you in Antwerp?

## Agenda

### Azure Pipelines versus Jenkins

<img src="/assets/media/speakers/bart-verhoeven.jpg" alt="Bart Verhoeven" align="right" height="100" width="100" style="margin-right: 20px;">Jenkins is a well known, open source CI/CD platform that is wideley used by many companies. Microsoft has its own CI/CD platform, called Azure Pipelines, which focuses on integration with the Azure environment. In this talk, I will compare both Jenkins and Azure Pipelines and show the main differences and similarities between the two platforms. In a demo, I will explain how you can use both of them to build and deploy a small web service to Microsoft Azure.

**Speaker: Bart Verhoeven** Motivated Linux and DevOps Engineer with a focus on Ops and a passion for Linux working at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/axxes/">Axxes</a>.  

### There are too many of them! What are we going to do?

<img src="/assets/media/speakers/nick-trogh.jpg" alt="Nick Trogh" align="right" height="100" width="100" style="margin-right: 20px;">Surely you haven't fell victim to saying "It works on my machine"! Your CI/CD pipeline is humming along, running your automated unit tests on every build and code coverage is at an all-time high. What could possibly go wrong? And that's when users started reporting that the website was slow and unavailable.Â 
In this talk, I'll provide an overview of Azure Load Testing and how you can use it improve your application reliability. You'll learn how to create and run load tests at scale, integrate it in your CI/CD pipeline, and how you can use the dashboard to identify application bottlenecks. Be prepared for loads of demos!

**Speaker: Nick Trogh** Technical writer at Microsoft, who's creating technical content for Microsoft's cloud testing and developer productivity services on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Learn</a>.
