In our second session of the year, we'll have a look at Azure pipelines versus Jenkins. See you in Antwerp?

## Agenda

### Azure Pipelines versus Jenkins

Jenkins is a well known, open source CI/CD platform that is wideley used by many companies. Microsoft has its own CI/CD platform, called Azure Pipelines, which focuses on integration with the Azure environment. In this talk, I will compare both Jenkins and Azure Pipelines and show the main differences and similarities between the two platforms. In a demo, I will explain how you can use both of them to build and deploy a small web service to Microsoft Azure.
