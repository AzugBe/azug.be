AZUG is glad to support the 7th edition of the Global Azure Bootcamp by hosting an event on Saturday 27nd of April in Belgium.

We will host a full day of Azure sessions, labs or just provide a workspace for people who have been thinking of a side project but are looking for a partner in crime. Networking is key and we want to make it a fun day for every attendee.
