<p>The third <a href="https://global.azurebootcamp.net">Global Azure Bootcamp</a> is around the corner! On the 25th of April the global Azure community gets together. In Belgium AZUG, IAMCT and Info Support have teamed up to organise a free day for Belgian enthusiasts. Join one of the sessions, hack away on the global lab or join the unconference. There's something for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<h2>Sessions</h2>
<h3>Leveraging the power of Microsoft Azure to build your Hyper-V disaster recovery datacenter</h3>
<p>Peter De Tender&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>High availability and disaster recovery are key components of an Enterprise&rsquo;s IT environment. While more and more companies are adopting Hyper-V on Server 2012 R2 for their private cloud solution, this session will show you how you can leverage on the power of Microsoft Azure, for building a Hyper-V based disaster recovery datacenter. That&rsquo;s right! You can migrate your in-house VM&rsquo;s to Microsoft Azure, guaranteeing uptime and availability of the machine and the applications to your end-users. Learn from Peter De Tender, Microsoft Infrastructure Architect, MCT and MVP how to achieve this, full of live demos.</em></p>
<h3>SaaS</h3>
<p>Tim Mahy&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Many applications today have high requirements concerning full text search. Microsoft offers a managed inverted index NoSQL data store in the Azure public cloud. Come and learn all about search and the Azure Search offering.</em></p>
<h3>App Service</h3>
<p>Glenn Dierckx &amp; Hans Peeters&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Microsoft just announced a new Azure component "App Service". In this session we'll tell you all about it.</em></p>
<h3>Moving to the cloud</h3>
<p>Reinhart De Lille&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Adifo Software has moved from delivering an on-premise application to a cloud based solution. This is not done overnight and in this session they will give us insight in the challenges they encountered and how they used Microsoft Azure to achieve their goal.</em></p>
<h3>Machine Learning</h3>
<p>Benny Michielsen&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>What's machine learning all about and how can I use it in my application. In this session we'll show you how to get started with Machine Learning in Azure and use it to add predections in an application.</em></p>
