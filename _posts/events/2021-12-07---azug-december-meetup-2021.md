After months of being confined to our desks to learn and share experiences about Azure,
the time has come to leave our desks behind and meet up in person.
Not virtual, not hybrid: an actual "put on some shoes and come over" event.

On **December 7, 2021**, let's get together and enjoy an afternoon with 3 talks!

Note that while current COVID-19 measures allow for a decent-size event, we're limiting the number of participants to this meetup to not overcrowd the event location.
