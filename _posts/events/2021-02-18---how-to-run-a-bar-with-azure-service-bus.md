Did you know you could build your own bar in Azure?

## Agenda

### How to run a bar with Azure Service Bus

In these covid-times we all miss our legendary moments in the local pub. But did you know you could build your own bar in Azure?

This session will provide you the means to start your own bar using Azure Service Bus!
* Order drinks and serve drinks (Enqueue messages)
* Process orders and do ad fundums like a pro (Dequeue messages)
* Take place and leave the bar as you have never been done before (Management through the SDK)
