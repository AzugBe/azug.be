<p>Tonight, Benny Michielsen will give us an introduction to HDInsight and Storm, two technologies for handling unbounded streams of data. We'll have Sam Vanhoutte as well, with a session on Azure IoT Suite.</p>
<h2>Sessions</h2>
<h3>Processing a stream of events with HDInsight &amp; Storm</h3>
<p>In this session you'll be introduced to HDInsight &amp; Storm. Storm is used by Facebook, Twitter, Yahoo, Spotify and many others. Apache Storm makes it easy to process unbouded streams of data in realtime. It can be used in many different areas: analytics, machine learning, distributed RPC, etc.. It's possible to create a Storm application in Azure using HDInsight and use .NET, Java or both to suit your specific needs. By the end of the session you'll know all the core concepts and be ready to go!</p>

<p><em>Speaker: <a href="http://blog.bennymichielsen.be/" target="_blank">Benny Michelsen</a> is a software developer experienced in the Microsoft .NET framework and has assisted and led teams to create object-oriented solutions. These varied from stand alone Windows applications to full fledged distributed programs. He's always learning new technologies and theories to improve his programming skills and is very interested in what's going on after a button is clicked, knowing how all the dots are connected is what he enjoys most. Although his professional work is mostly based around the .NET ecosystem, Benny has a keen interest in other programming languages and the open source world in general.</em></p>
<h3>Azure IoT Suite. A look behind the curtain.</h3>
<p>Azure IoT Suite was announced last year and it seems there are people who tend to believe that it will make real IoT solutions easy to set up and quick to deploy. &nbsp;In this session, you will get an overview of the features and capabilities of Azure ioT Suite. &nbsp;Some interesting demos will show how to register devices, send telemetry information and commands to and from devices. &nbsp;But after the magic, a touch with reality will be held. &nbsp;The various components will be discussed. Extensibility and customization will be shown. After this session, attendees should get a good understanding of the possibilities of Azure IoT suite. Attendees should also get a better understanding of the possibilities to apply Azure IoT Suite in real world scenarios. Expect demos and tons of honest feedback!</p>
