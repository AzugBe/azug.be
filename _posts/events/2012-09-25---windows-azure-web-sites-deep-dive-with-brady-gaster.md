<h2>Session info</h2>
<h3>Windows Azure Web Sites deep-dive</h3>
<p><img width="120" height="175" align="right" alt="" src="/assets/media/speakers/brady-gaster.jpg">Windows Azure Web Sites offers web developers a new, streamlined method of getting a web site or HTTP-based API into the cloud. With support for .NET code, classic ASP, Node.js, PHP, and Python, Web Sites is a versatile solution for virtually any web development platform. During this talk, Microsoft Windows Azure Evangelist and Channel 9 Web Camps TV co-host Brady Gaster will show you how to use Windows Azure Web Sites to get your site up and running, and will walk through some of the deeper technical underpinnings of the Web Sites offering. Then, Brady will show you how to connect a site hosted in Windows Azure to other resources, such as Windows Azure storage, a back-end Cloud Service application that adds middle-tier functionality to your web application, a SQL database, and more. If time permits following the deep dive into Windows Azure Web Sites, we&rsquo;ll explore some of the other new features of Windows Azure that will enhance your cloud-based applications and streamline your entry into cloud-based development. Windows Azure has a huge set of features, and this talk will explore those features from the point of view of a web application developer who wants greater scale and deeper functionality than ever before.</p>
