<p>When you want to manage repetitive Azure IaaS tasks and processes efficiently, Azure Portal is not good enough. You cannot even perform some of the tasks in a portal. We will talk about how to use PowerShell and PowerShell Workflow-based Azure Automation to automate tasks in Azure. With automation, IT costs can be reduced and efficient deployments are made possible.</p>
