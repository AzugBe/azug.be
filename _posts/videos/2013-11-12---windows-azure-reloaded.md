<p><strong>Windows Azure Reloaded</strong></p>
<p>In this session will look at many of the new features and enhancements to Windows Azure. If we can, we&rsquo;ll look at things that will soon be generally available as well as features that have recently be released. Topics will include Windows Azure Mobile Services, HDInsight, SQL Database, and more. We&rsquo;ll take a deep look at these new and enhanced services and how you can leverage to the fullest.</p>
