## A Case Study - Data Movement and Transformation using Azure Data Factory

In this session, I will provide a basic introduction to Azure Data Factory, a scalable cloud-based data integration service. I will show a case study to move data from Azure Blob Storage to Azure SQL Server. Furthermore, I will show you how you can transform data on the fly with Azure Data Factory Mapping Data Flows. In the demo, I will also demonstrate how you can parameterize your pipelines for more metadata-driven development. This demo will also use the following technologies:

- Azure Key Vault
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Blob Storage
- Azure DevOps
- Azure Data Factory and its Data Flows.

The main goal of this session is to provide basic knowledge of ADF using a case study so attendees will leave with ADF knowledge and how to apply this in different scenarios.
