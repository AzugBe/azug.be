<p>As a developer you often have to use &amp; store a lot of sensitive data going from service credentials to connection strings or even encryption keys. But how do I store these in a secure way? How do I know who has access to them and how do I prevent people from copying them and abusing them? On the other hand, SaaS customers have no clue how you store their sensitive data and how they use it. How can they monitor that? How can they revoke your access easily?</p>
<p>In this session I&rsquo;ll guide you to securely store keys, credentials and other secrets in the cloud with Azure Key Vault. You will also see that SaaS customers are still the owners of their sensitive data and can monitor everything.</p>
