<p>As we see our customer demand shift from occasional development or migration of silo applications to integrated Cloud solutions and even entire datacenter migrations, managing our Cloud resources becomes a nightmare. This session will show how to take control and regain productivity in managing those large scale Windows Azure solutions using Windows (Azure) PowerShell.</p>

<p><i>Speaker: <a href="http://onwindowsazure.com/" target="_blank">Patriek van Dorp</a> - As a Technology Consultant at Sogeti in The Netherlands, I'm passionate about helping businesses grow by using the right technologies. I'm an expert in designing and implementing complex Cloud Computing solutions for the Enterprise using Microsoft's Cloud platform, Windows Azure. As I started my IT career as a Systems Engineer I've worked in Operations for several years before I re-educated to become a Software Engineer. This enables me to bridge the gap between IT Operations and Development and produce well integrated Enterprise solutions. Three years ago I co-founded the Dutch Windows Azure User Group (WAZUGNL) and I'm a regular speaker at community events and conferences in The Netherlands and abroad. I have been rewarded the Microsoft MVP award for three years in a row now.</i></p>
