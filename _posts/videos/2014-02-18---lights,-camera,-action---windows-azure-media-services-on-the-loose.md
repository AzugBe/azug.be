<p>You just cannot imagine the Web without audio and video services. Up until now, if you want to include streaming media content in your websites or applications, you need to rely on third party services or massive computing capacity for media transcoding, and streaming to a range of client devices. With the release of Windows Azure Media Services and the Media Services SDK, these capabilities are becoming easily available for you to incorporate in your websites and applications. In this session we'll give an overview of Windows Azure Media Services, and you'll learn from a series of demos how you can take advantage of the platform to add media content to your development. We'll also see what the competition has in store and what's missing.</p>
