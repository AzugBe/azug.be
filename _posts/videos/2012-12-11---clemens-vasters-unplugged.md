<p>It's not often that we can find the Technical Lead for Windows Azure Service Bus to come and speak at AZUG. As the last event of 2012, we do have Clemens Vasters coming over. No PowerPoint, just Clemens and a whiteboard. He'll talk architecture, service bus, cloud and whatever <em>you</em> ask him to talk about.</p>
