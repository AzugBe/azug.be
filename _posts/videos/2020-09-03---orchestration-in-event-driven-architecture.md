## Orchestration in Event Driven architecture

Event Driven architecture (EDA) becomes more and more popular and Azure comes with many services which you can use in
your solutions design to build EDA. However, choosing between Service Bus, Event Hub and Event Grid is not always easy.
On top of that, while you want to leverage parallelism, elasticity and all the goodness of the Cloud, you usually need
to reconciliate all the operations at the end of the day, and that is called orchestration.

In this session, I'll come back to the fundamental differences between ESB-like architectures and EDA and I'll demo
different orchestration patterns one can use to build resilient and robust EDA, mostly using Azure Durable Functions.
As usual, the session is inspired from real-world applications!
