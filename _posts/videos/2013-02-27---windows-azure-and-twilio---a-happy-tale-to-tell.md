<p>Taking advantage of Twilio&rsquo;s awesomeness and Windows Azure&rsquo;s scalability, we decided to build call center in the cloud. It was finished with some salt from ASP.NET MVC Web API and bonded with SignalR. The end result was tasty and I&rsquo;m here to share the tale and the recipe of creating a highly scalable call center solution using only cloud services.</p>
