<p><img alt="" align="right" src="/assets/media/speakers/alan-smith.jpg" width="120" height="175">April 27th, 2013. What started as an idea to run a Windows Azure Bootcamp on a couple of locations around the world grew into almost 100 locations giving a free one-day Windows Azure training. To start the day and get people up to speed quickly, a render lab had to be deployed. With all attendees, there have been almost 10.000 machines running, all retrieving jobs to render and posting their data to a centralized location. In this talk, Alan will tell you how he scaled this workload across thousands of machines in a reliable way.</p>
