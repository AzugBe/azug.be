<p><strong>Real-time Data Management in the Cloud</strong><br>Everyone is currently talking about Big Data problems and always think about technologies like Hadoop, Elastic MR and so on, but all those are done for data analytics not in real-time. When we think about real-time systems like CCTV analysis for disturbances, Financial Markets, Manufacturing with real-time adjustments of the production everything becomes different. In this session, we will be talking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is Real-time and when should I care?</li>
<li>Scenarios where it might fit</li>
<li>Event Driven Architectures</li>
<li>How Cloud can help getting real-time solutions</li>
<li>What products/frameworks can help? (NServiceBus,&nbsp;NESPER,&nbsp;MessageHandler,&nbsp;Reactive Extensions, ...)</li>
</ul>
