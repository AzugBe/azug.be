<p>Azure Networking is one of the core fundamentals of building solid Cloud Solutions. Though very important in any architecture, many different skills and topics need to be mastered. In this session, we will bring you the content and let you experience and practice the content yourself. No death by powerpoint, but an opportunity to learn and grow together with peers.</p>
<p>In the first part, Nills and Kristof will walk you through the Azure Networking fundamentals and do a deep dive on VNETs, peering, gateways, ExpressRoute and networking best practices.</p>
<p>In the second part, it&rsquo;s up to you, guided by 2 experienced Microsoft Architects. You will group together with other Azure lovers and work on an architecture for a real and deployed customer case, based on real business and technical requirements. After this architecture design session, you will have the opportunity to present your favorite solution to another team, gathering feedback and discuss various solutions and options.</p>
<p>In the end, you will receive an overview of the reference implementation, and the final architecture implemented at the customer.</p>
<p>Take this opportunity to learn Azure Networking and grow from a Rookie to Expert, to become a true Azure Networking Master!</p>
