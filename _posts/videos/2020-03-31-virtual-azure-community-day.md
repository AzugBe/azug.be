AZUG has been hosting track 2 of [Virtual Azure Community Day](https://azureday.community). Together with several other user groups, we've organized the Virtual Azure Community Day. We had multiple streams happening in parallel, one per country from which we were airing.

Session recordings of all track 2 videos can be found below. Other tracks are available from the [Virtual Azure Community Day](https://azureday.community) website.

## Azure Kubernetes Service Basics

Containerized applications have become an essential part of our everyday life. Learn everything about Kubernetes and how you can run it in the Azure Cloud. 

In this talk, Nico will explain how Kubernetes work and how it can help to run Containers in production. You will learn everything about Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure Container Registry and Azure Container Instances.

Get to know the basics as well as the best practices that you can implement straight away!

## Cloud Native by Design

The "cloud" has been available to developers for over a decade with exciting services that really boost your applications to the next level. Why is it that the majority of applications running on these cloud platforms are still built as though it's 1990's with complex infrastructures? Today there's no longer a need to build tightly integrated applications.

In this talk I will discuss 15 years of cloud development showing examples of old-fashioned application architectures that are still being produced today. To counter these examples I will also show you how easy it is today to build applications cloud-native so they are outperforming the competition, are easily maintainable and are resilient against failures.

The goal of this talk is to have you rethink the way you develop for the cloud and how you can adopt my approaches in your own architectures.

## Getting real time insights from your serverless solution

The SignalR real-time framework has been there for ages, but how do you connect to services as volatile like Azure Functions?

In my session, I will show you how to create a SignalR service, send messages to the SignalR service and handle events on a connected SPA application.

## Zero Credential Development with Managed Identities for Azure Resources

Keys are always needed to access services in Azure and beyond. Storing and managing keys presents many problems, for example rotating and disabling them. Keys often also allow blanket access to the service with no way to limit it. Sometimes there is only one key that needs to be shared by services, so you won't have any way to disable access from one individually.

In this talk we will go through Managed Identities for Azure Resources, how they work, and how you can use them to use Azure services in a secure way without having to manage any keys yourself. We will go through a demo application which uses various Azure services through a managed identity, removing the need to use keys entirely.

The source code will be available to the audience so they have samples that they can use to implement managed identities in their own applications.
