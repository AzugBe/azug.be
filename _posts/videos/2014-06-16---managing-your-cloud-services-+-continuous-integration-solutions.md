<p>Deploying your Azure solution is only a first step. Once in production you&rsquo;ll need a way to manage the deployed service. You&rsquo;ll want to gather performance diagnostics, create and read logfiles, monitor the use of your databases, (re)deploy the service automated, swap between staging and production, scale out extra instances &hellip; This is possible through the portal of course, but we need a more automated way to manage everything. Azure has some management and diagnostics API&rsquo;s, SQL Azure has management views, Storage has a logging API,&hellip; &nbsp;Let's dive in these. In this talk we share an overview of the different API&rsquo;s and how to use them. You&rsquo;ll also be happy to see a demo of some management tool I&rsquo;ve build that integrates into TFS for continuous integration.</p>
