All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our user group events and conferences are required to agree with the following code of conduct. AZUG will enforce this code throughout user group events and conferences. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

## The Quick Version

Our user group events and conferences are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media.

Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the user group event or conference without a refund at the discretion of AZUG.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, AZUG may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the user group event or conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact AZUG immediately.

AZUG will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the user group event or conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and related social events.
